# Table-Surfer

Hello Table Surfer Team,

Before you pull or clone the code from this repository, Please look at this introduction and version control protocol.

1. To avoid code conflict when commit or merge your code with the master, we will assign each team member's task's every iteration before we go into coding.
2. By assigning tasks to each member, we mean that each team member is responsible for one functional code module. In this way, we avoid the code version conflict and prevent chaotic change on each other's code.
